## Project Scenario

Project was build up to facilitate a Online Library Management Syste where the Library Manager can 

* Analyse search  book or Dvd items to the Library Store
* Edit a Item in the LIbrary

## References

I Cloned the Backend From  [Java Play Angular Seed](https://github.com/yohangz/java-play-angular-seed) gitHug project.. Many thanks to them finding a way to bind a Play framework Back-end with  a Angular Front end.

## Important

I didn't conencted a Databse for this system. Since my focus is towards for Front-end tHere is only some hard-coded values in the back-end.

## Communication

The communication is based on a  Ajax Request. Totally Asynchronous communication. Since the communication with the back-end is not frequently occured I gave up the thought of using WebSockets.

## Future Implementaitions

* Need to add a Login with restrisctions on accessible features of the system
* Give Admin a panel to control the User Restrictions.
